[FIDO](https://github.com/openpreserve/fido) is a command-line tool to identify the file formats of digital objects. It is designed for simple integration into automated work-flows. FIDO uses the UK National Archives (TNA) PRONOM File Format and Container descriptions. PRONOM is available from <http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom/>.
