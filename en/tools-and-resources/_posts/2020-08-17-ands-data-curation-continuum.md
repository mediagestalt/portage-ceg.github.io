The [ANDS Data Curation Continuum Guide](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/curation-continuum) introduces the concepts of the data curation continuum and curation boundary, and describes how they impact on the management of research data for discovery and reuse. It is likely to be of interest to researchers who create data, to research data stewards and to data management professionals.
